    <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
    <b> <u>Abstract:</u> </b>
    <p>   Bangladesh – one of the most densely populated countries of 
          the world— has plentiful water sources, but these sources are 
          being polluted continuously. Both surface water and groundwater 
          sources are contaminated with different contaminants like toxic 
          trace metals, coliforms as well as other organic and inorganic pollutants.
          As most of the population uses these water sources, especially groundwater 
          sources which contain an elevated amount of arsenic throughout the country;
          health risk regarding consuming water is very high.

    <strong><u>Introduction:</u></strong>
        <p>  Why are we able to live in this planet? Why are other animals 
             and plants allowed to live here? If we endeavor to find out the 
             answer of these inquisitions, we may easily perceive that water 
             is the spring of life. According to biologists, all life form came
             from the sea means water. We are living on this planet due to the
             blessing of water. From the dawn of civilization to till now, 
             humans (cave dwellers to city dwellers) have been using water
             for various seminal purposes: drinking, bathing, watering animals,
             and irrigating lands. However, this limited resource means source of 
             life under threat from the population, chiefly generated by human factors. 
             Almost 71% of the earth's total surface is covered with water, only 2.5% of
             this amount can be considered as freshwater (Shiklomanov, 1993). At present,
             1.6 billion of people are facing economic water shortage, and two-thirds of 
             the world's population is experiencing water scarcity at least one month in
             a year (FAO, 2007; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016).

        The physicochemical properties of water can influence the development of 
         biological life form in water and subsequently can cause an impact on the 
         quality of water (Soja and Wiejaczka, 2014). Physical properties such as 
         temperature, turbidity, electrical conductivity and chemical properties
         for instance dissolved oxygen (DO), Biological oxygen demand (BOD), Chemical
         oxygen demand (COD), all come under this group.
         Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD, or more specifically BOD5) can be
         used as an indication of the extent of organic pollution in the
          aquatic systems, which adversely affect the water quality (Jonnalagadda and Mhere, 2001).

             Conclusion:
         </u>
     </b>
     <p>
        In short, arsenic pollution is a genuine risk to drinking water 
        in Bangladesh, overexposure of arsenic not only increases the probability
         of diseases like lung cancer, renal cancer, skin cancer but also it may create 
         a generation like “arsenic orphans”
